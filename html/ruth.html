And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>2</strong></a> And the name of the man <i>was</i> Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah.

<p id="ru-ch1-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>3</strong></a> And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>4</strong></a> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one <i>was</i> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>5</strong></a> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>6</strong></a> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>7</strong></a> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>8</strong></a> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</p>

<p id="ru-ch1-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>13</strong></a> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>14</strong></a> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>15</strong></a> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>16</strong></a> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, <i>or</i> to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people <i>shall be</i> my people, and thy God my God:</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>17</strong></a> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, <i>if ought</i> but death part thee and me.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>18</strong></a> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>19</strong></a> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, <i>Is</i> this Naomi?</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>20</strong></a> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>21</strong></a> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why <i>then</i> call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</p>
<p id="ru-ch1-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru1.</span>22</strong></a> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>

<p id="ru-ch2-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>1</strong></a> And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name <i>was</i> Boaz.</p>

<p id="ru-ch2-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>3</strong></a> And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field <i>belonging</i> unto Boaz, who <i>was</i> of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>
<p id="ru-ch2-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>4</strong></a> And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD <i>be</i> with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</p>

<p id="ru-ch2-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>8</strong></a> Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</p>

<p id="ru-ch2-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>10</strong></a> Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I <i>am</i> a stranger?</p>
<p id="ru-ch2-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>11</strong></a> And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and <i>how</i> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>

<p id="ru-ch2-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>14</strong></a> And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.

<p id="ru-ch2-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru2.</span>15</strong></a> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</p>

<p id="ru-ch3-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch3"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru3.</span>10</strong></a> And he said, Blessed <i>be</i> thou of the LORD, my daughter: <i>for</i> thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</p>
<p id="ru-ch3-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch3"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru3.</span>11</strong></a> And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou <i>art</i> a virtuous woman.</p>

<p id="ru-ch3-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch3"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru3.</span>14</strong></a> And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another.

<p id="ru-ch3-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch3"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru3.</span>16</strong></a> And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who <i>art</i> thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>

<p id="ru-ch4-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>1</strong></a> Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>2</strong></a> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>3</strong></a> And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which <i>was</i> our brother Elimelech's:</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>4</strong></a> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy <i>it</i> before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem <i>it</i>, redeem <i>it</i>: but if thou wilt not redeem <i>it, then</i> tell me, that I may know: for <i>there is</i> none to redeem <i>it</i> beside thee; and I <i>am</i> after thee. And he said, I will redeem <i>it</i>.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>5</strong></a> Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy <i>it</i> also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>6</strong></a> And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem <i>it</i> for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem <i>it</i>.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>7</strong></a> Now this <i>was the manner</i> in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave <i>it</i> to his neighbour: and this <i>was</i> a testimony in Israel.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>8</strong></a> Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy <i>it</i> for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>9</strong></a> And Boaz said unto the elders, and <i>unto</i> all the people, Ye <i>are</i> witnesses this day, that I have bought all that <i>was</i> Elimelech's, and all that <i>was</i> Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>10</strong></a> Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye <i>are</i> witnesses this day.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>11</strong></a> And all the people that <i>were</i> in the gate, and the elders, said, <i>We are</i> witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>12</strong></a> And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>13</strong></a> So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>14</strong></a> And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>15</strong></a> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of <i>thy</i> life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>16</strong></a> And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>17</strong></a> And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he <i>is</i> the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>
<p id="ru-ch4-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="ruth.html#ru-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ru4.</span>18</strong></a> Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p>
