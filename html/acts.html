<p id="ac-ch1-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>4</strong></a> And, being assembled together with <i>them</i>, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, <i>saith he</i>, ye have heard of me.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>5</strong></a> For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>6</strong></a> When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>7</strong></a> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</p>

<p id="ac-ch1-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>12</strong></a> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>13</strong></a> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas <i>the brother</i> of James.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>14</strong></a> These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>15</strong></a> And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</p>

<p id="ac-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>20</strong></a> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>21</strong></a> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</p>

<p id="ac-ch1-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>23</strong></a> And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>24</strong></a> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all <i>men</i>, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>25</strong></a> That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</p>
<p id="ac-ch1-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac1.</span>26</strong></a> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>

<p id="ac-ch7-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>1</strong></a> Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>2</strong></a> And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>3</strong></a> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>4</strong></a> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>5</strong></a> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not <i>so much as</i> to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when <i>as yet</i> he had no child.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>6</strong></a> And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat <i>them</i> evil four hundred years.</p>

<p id="ac-ch7-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>8</strong></a> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so <i>Abraham</i> begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac <i>begat</i> Jacob; and Jacob <i>begat</i> the twelve patriarchs.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>9</strong></a> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>10</strong></a> And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>11</strong></a> Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>12</strong></a> But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</p>

<p id="ac-ch7-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>14</strong></a> Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to <i>him</i>, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>15</strong></a> So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</p>

<p id="ac-ch7-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>17</strong></a> But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>18</strong></a> Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>19</strong></a> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>20</strong></a> In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>21</strong></a> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>22</strong></a> And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>23</strong></a> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>24</strong></a> And seeing one <i>of them</i> suffer wrong, he defended <i>him</i>, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>25</strong></a> For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>26</strong></a> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>27</strong></a> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>28</strong></a> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>29</strong></a> Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v30" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>30</strong></a> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v31" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>31</strong></a> When Moses saw <i>it</i>, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold <i>it</i>, the voice of the Lord came unto him,</p>

<p id="ac-ch7-v33" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>33</strong></a> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</p>

<p id="ac-ch7-v35" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>35</strong></a> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send <i>to be</i> a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v36" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>36</strong></a> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</p>
<p id="ac-ch7-v37" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac7.</span>37</strong></a> This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</p>

<p id="ac-ch8-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>2</strong></a> And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him.</p>

<p id="ac-ch8-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>4</strong></a> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>5</strong></a> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>6</strong></a> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>7</strong></a> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p>

<p id="ac-ch8-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>9</strong></a> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>10</strong></a> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>11</strong></a> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>12</strong></a> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>13</strong></a> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>14</strong></a> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>15</strong></a> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>16</strong></a> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>17</strong></a> Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>18</strong></a> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>19</strong></a> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>20</strong></a> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>21</strong></a> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>22</strong></a> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>23</strong></a> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>24</strong></a> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>25</strong></a> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>26</strong></a> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>27</strong></a> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>28</strong></a> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>29</strong></a> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v30" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>30</strong></a> And Philip ran thither to <i>him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v31" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>31</strong></a> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v32" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>32</strong></a> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>

<p id="ac-ch8-v34" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>34</strong></a> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p id="ac-ch8-v35" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>35</strong></a> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p>

<p id="ac-ch8-v37" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac8.</span>37</strong></a> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>

<p id="ac-ch9-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>18</strong></a> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</p>

<p id="ac-ch9-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>20</strong></a> And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>21</strong></a> But all that heard <i>him</i> were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>22</strong></a> But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>23</strong></a> And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</p>

<p id="ac-ch9-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>25</strong></a> Then the disciples took him by night, and let <i>him</i> down by the wall in a basket.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>26</strong></a> And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>27</strong></a> But Barnabas took him, and brought <i>him</i> to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>28</strong></a> And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</p>

<p id="ac-ch9-v32" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>32</strong></a> And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all <i>quarters</i>, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v33" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>33</strong></a> And there he found a certain man named AEneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</p>

<p id="ac-ch9-v35" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>35</strong></a> And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v36" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>36</strong></a> Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v37" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>37</strong></a> And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid <i>her</i> in an upper chamber.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v38" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>38</strong></a> And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring <i>him</i> that he would not delay to come to them.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v39" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>39</strong></a> Then Peter arose and went with them.

<p id="ac-ch9-v40" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>40</strong></a> But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning <i>him</i> to the body said, Tabitha, arise.

<p id="ac-ch9-v41" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>41</strong></a> And he gave her <i>his</i> hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</p>
<p id="ac-ch9-v42" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac9.</span>42</strong></a> And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</p>

<p id="ac-ch12-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>5</strong></a> Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p>

<p id="ac-ch12-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>8</strong></a> And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</p>

<p id="ac-ch12-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>12</strong></a> And when he had considered <i>the thing</i>, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</p>

<p id="ac-ch12-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>18</strong></a> Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</p>

<p id="ac-ch12-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>20</strong></a> And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's <i>country</i>.</p>
<p id="ac-ch12-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>21</strong></a> And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</p>
<p id="ac-ch12-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac12.</span>22</strong></a> And the people gave a shout, <i>saying, It is</i> the voice of a god, and not of a man.</p>

<p id="ac-ch13-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac13.</span>1</strong></a> Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p>
<p id="ac-ch13-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac13.</span>2</strong></a> As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</p>

<p id="ac-ch13-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac13.</span>4</strong></a> So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
<p id="ac-ch13-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac13.</span>5</strong></a> And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to <i>their</i> minister.</p>

<p id="ac-ch13-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac13.</span>12</strong></a> Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>

<p id="ac-ch19-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>1</strong></a> And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>2</strong></a> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?

<p id="ac-ch19-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>4</strong></a> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p>

<p id="ac-ch19-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>6</strong></a> And when Paul had laid <i>his</i> hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>7</strong></a> And all the men were about twelve.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>8</strong></a> And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>9</strong></a> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>10</strong></a> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>11</strong></a> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</p>

<p id="ac-ch19-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>13</strong></a> Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>14</strong></a> And there were seven sons of <i>one</i> Sceva, a Jew, <i>and</i> chief of the priests, which did so.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>15</strong></a> And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>16</strong></a> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>17</strong></a> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>18</strong></a> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</p>

<p id="ac-ch19-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>20</strong></a> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>21</strong></a> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>22</strong></a> So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
<p id="ac-ch19-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac19.</span>23</strong></a> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>

<p id="ac-ch23-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch23"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac23.</span>19</strong></a> Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <i>with him</i> aside privately, and asked <i>him</i>, What is that thou hast to tell me?</p>
<p id="ac-ch23-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch23"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac23.</span>20</strong></a> And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</p>

<p id="ac-ch23-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch23"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac23.</span>22</strong></a> So the chief captain <i>then</i> let the young man depart, and charged <i>him, See thou</i> tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</p>
<p id="ac-ch23-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch23"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac23.</span>23</strong></a> And he called unto <i>him</i> two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</p>
<p id="ac-ch23-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch23"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac23.</span>24</strong></a> And provide <i>them</i> beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring <i>him</i> safe unto Felix the governor.</p>

<p id="ac-ch25-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>4</strong></a> But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly <i>thither</i>.</p>

<p id="ac-ch25-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>12</strong></a> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p>

<p id="ac-ch25-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>16</strong></a> To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p>
<p id="ac-ch25-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>17</strong></a> Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p>
<p id="ac-ch25-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>18</strong></a> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>

<p id="ac-ch25-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>20</strong></a> And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked <i>him</i> whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p>
<p id="ac-ch25-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>21</strong></a> But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p>
<p id="ac-ch25-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>22</strong></a> Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>

<p id="ac-ch25-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>24</strong></a> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and <i>also</i> here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p>
<p id="ac-ch25-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch25"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac25.</span>25</strong></a> But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>

<p id="ac-ch27-v43" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch27"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac27.</span>43</strong></a> But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from <i>their</i> purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast <i>themselves</i> first <i>into the sea</i>, and get to land:</p>
<p id="ac-ch27-v44" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch27"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac27.</span>44</strong></a> And the rest, some on boards, and some on <i>broken pieces</i> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</p>

<p id="ac-ch28-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>1</strong></a> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>2</strong></a> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>3</strong></a> And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>4</strong></a> And when the barbarians saw the <i>venomous</i> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>5</strong></a> And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>6</strong></a> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>7</strong></a> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>8</strong></a> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>9</strong></a> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>10</strong></a> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <i>us</i> with such things as were necessary.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>11</strong></a> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>12</strong></a> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <i>there</i> three days.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>13</strong></a> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>14</strong></a> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>15</strong></a> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>16</strong></a> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>17</strong></a> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>18</strong></a> Who, when they had examined me, would have let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>19</strong></a> But when the Jews spake against <i>it</i>, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>20</strong></a> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <i>you</i>, and to speak with <i>you</i>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>21</strong></a> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>22</strong></a> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>23</strong></a> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i>his</i> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <i>out of</i> the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>24</strong></a> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>25</strong></a> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>26</strong></a> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>27</strong></a> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>28</strong></a> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <i>that</i> they will hear it.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>29</strong></a> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v30" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>30</strong></a> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p>
<p id="ac-ch28-v31" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="acts.html#ac-ch28"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ac28.</span>31</strong></a> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
