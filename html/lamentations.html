<p id="la-ch1-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>8</strong></a> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>

<p id="la-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>16</strong></a> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</p>

<p id="la-ch1-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>18</strong></a> The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</p>
<p id="la-ch1-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>19</strong></a> I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</p>
<p id="la-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>20</strong></a> Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</p>
<p id="la-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>21</strong></a> They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</p>
<p id="la-ch1-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">La1.</span>22</strong></a> Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</p>

<p id="la-ch2-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>2</strong></a> The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>3</strong></a> He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>4</strong></a> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>5</strong></a> The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</p>

<p id="la-ch2-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>7</strong></a> The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>8</strong></a> The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>9</strong></a> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</p>

<p id="la-ch2-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>14</strong></a> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</p>

<p id="la-ch2-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>17</strong></a> The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>18</strong></a> Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</p>

<p id="la-ch2-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>20</strong></a> Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.

<p id="la-ch2-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>21</strong></a> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.</p>
<p id="la-ch2-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">La2.</span>22</strong></a> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</p>

<p id="la-ch4-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="lamentations.html#la-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">La4.</span>9</strong></a> They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.</p>
