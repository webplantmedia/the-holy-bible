Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v10"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>10</strong></a>  Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v11"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>11</strong></a>  Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>12</strong></a>  And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>13</strong></a>  Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v14"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>14</strong></a>  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v15"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>15</strong></a>  Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v16"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>16</strong></a>  And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v17"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>17</strong></a>  According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch1-v18"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos1.</span>18</strong></a>  Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</p><a class="chapter-anchor" name="joshua-ch2"></a><h4>Joshua 2</h4><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch2-v1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos2.</span>1</strong></a>  And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho.

And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>7</strong></a>  And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>8</strong></a>  And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the

Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v10"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>10</strong></a>  And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v11"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>11</strong></a>  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the

from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v14"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>14</strong></a>  And it came to pass, when the people

class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>15</strong></a>  And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v16"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>16</strong></a>  That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch3-v17"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos3.</span>17</strong></a>  And the priests that bare the ark of the

name="joshua-ch4"></a><h4>Joshua 4</h4><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>1</strong></a>  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>2</strong></a>  Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v3"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>3</strong></a>  And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>4</strong></a>  Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v5"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>5</strong></a>  And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v6"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>6</strong></a>  That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>7</strong></a>  Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>8</strong></a>  And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>9</strong></a>  And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the

class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>10</strong></a>  For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v11"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>11</strong></a>  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v12"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>12</strong></a>  And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v13"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>13</strong></a>  About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v14"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>14</strong></a>  On that day the LORD

class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>15</strong></a>  And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v16"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>16</strong></a>  Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v17"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>17</strong></a>  Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v18"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>18</strong></a>  And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch4-v19"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos4.</span>19</strong></a>

the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch5-v2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Jos5.</span>2</strong></a>  At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second

land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p><p><a class="verse-anchor" name="joshua-ch5-v7"><strong><span
