<p id="es-ch1-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>2</strong></a> That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>3</strong></a> In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>4</strong></a> When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</p>

<p id="es-ch1-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>6</strong></a> Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>7</strong></a> And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>8</strong></a> And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>9</strong></a> Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>10</strong></a> On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>11</strong></a> To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>12</strong></a> But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>13</strong></a> Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>14</strong></a> And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>15</strong></a> What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>16</strong></a> And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>17</strong></a> For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>18</strong></a> Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>19</strong></a> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>20</strong></a> And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>21</strong></a> And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</p>
<p id="es-ch1-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es1.</span>22</strong></a> For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</p>

<p id="es-ch2-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>1</strong></a> After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>2</strong></a> Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>3</strong></a> And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>4</strong></a> And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>5</strong></a> Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>6</strong></a> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>7</strong></a> And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>8</strong></a> So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>9</strong></a> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>10</strong></a> Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>11</strong></a> And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>12</strong></a> Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>13</strong></a> Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>14</strong></a> In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>15</strong></a> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>16</strong></a> So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>17</strong></a> And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>18</strong></a> Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>19</strong></a> And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>20</strong></a> Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>21</strong></a> In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>22</strong></a> And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</p>
<p id="es-ch2-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es2.</span>23</strong></a> And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p>

<p id="es-ch4-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch4"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es4.</span>15</strong></a> Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</p>

<p id="es-ch9-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>24</strong></a> Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</p>
<p id="es-ch9-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>25</strong></a> But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</p>
<p id="es-ch9-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>26</strong></a> Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.

<p id="es-ch9-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>27</strong></a> The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;</p>
<p id="es-ch9-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>28</strong></a> And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</p>
<p id="es-ch9-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>29</strong></a> Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</p>
<p id="es-ch9-v30" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="esther.html#es-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Es9.</span>30</strong></a> And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,</p>
