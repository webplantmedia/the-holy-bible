<p id="2ki-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="2-kings.html#2ki-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">2Ki1.</span>16</strong></a> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, <i>is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p>
<p id="2ki-ch1-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="2-kings.html#2ki-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">2Ki1.</span>17</strong></a> So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.

<p id="2ki-ch6-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="2-kings.html#2ki-ch6"><strong><span class="hide-this">2Ki6.</span>20</strong></a> And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these <i>men</i>, that they may see.

<p id="2ki-ch6-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="2-kings.html#2ki-ch6"><strong><span class="hide-this">2Ki6.</span>21</strong></a> And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite <i>them</i>? shall I smite <i>them</i>?</p>
