<p id="lu-ch1-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>1</strong></a> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>2</strong></a> Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>3</strong></a> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>4</strong></a> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>5</strong></a> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <i>was</i> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <i>was</i> Elisabeth.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>6</strong></a> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>7</strong></a> And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <i>now</i> well stricken in years.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>8</strong></a> And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>9</strong></a> According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>10</strong></a> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>11</strong></a> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>12</strong></a> And when Zacharias saw <i>him</i>, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>13</strong></a> But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>14</strong></a> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>15</strong></a> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>16</strong></a> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>17</strong></a> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>18</strong></a> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>19</strong></a> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>20</strong></a> And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>21</strong></a> And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>22</strong></a> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>23</strong></a> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>24</strong></a> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>25</strong></a> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on <i>me</i>, to take away my reproach among men.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>26</strong></a> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>27</strong></a> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name <i>was</i> Mary.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>28</strong></a> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, <i>thou that art</i> highly favoured, the Lord <i>is</i> with thee: blessed <i>art</i> thou among women.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>29</strong></a> And when she saw <i>him</i>, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v30" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>30</strong></a> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v31" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>31</strong></a> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v32" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>32</strong></a> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</p>

<p id="lu-ch1-v34" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>34</strong></a> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v35" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>35</strong></a> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v36" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>36</strong></a> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v37" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>37</strong></a> For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v38" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>38</strong></a> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>
<p id="lu-ch1-v39" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>39</strong></a> And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</p>

<p id="lu-ch1-v41" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu1.</span>41</strong></a> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p id="lu-ch7-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>2</strong></a> And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>3</strong></a> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>4</strong></a> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>5</strong></a> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>6</strong></a> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>7</strong></a> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>8</strong></a> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <i>it</i>.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>9</strong></a> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>10</strong></a> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>

<p id="lu-ch7-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>12</strong></a> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>13</strong></a> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>

<p id="lu-ch7-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>15</strong></a> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>16</strong></a> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>17</strong></a> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>18</strong></a> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>19</strong></a> And John calling <i>unto him</i> two of his disciples sent <i>them</i> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>20</strong></a> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>21</strong></a> And in that same hour he cured many of <i>their</i> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <i>that were</i> blind he gave sight.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>22</strong></a> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>23</strong></a> And blessed is <i>he</i>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>24</strong></a> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?

<p id="lu-ch7-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>26</strong></a> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>27</strong></a> This is <i>he</i>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>28</strong></a> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>29</strong></a> And all the people that heard <i>him</i>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>

<p id="lu-ch7-v32" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>32</strong></a> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v33" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>33</strong></a> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>

<p id="lu-ch7-v36" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>36</strong></a> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v37" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>37</strong></a> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>

<p id="lu-ch7-v39" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>39</strong></a> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <i>it</i>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <i>this is</i> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v40" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>40</strong></a> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
<p id="lu-ch7-v41" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu7.</span>41</strong></a> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>

<p id="lu-ch8-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>7</strong></a> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</p>
<p id="lu-ch8-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>8</strong></a> And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.

<p id="lu-ch8-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>9</strong></a> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</p>
<p id="lu-ch8-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>10</strong></a> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>
<p id="lu-ch8-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>11</strong></a> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>

<p id="lu-ch8-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>23</strong></a> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled <i>with water</i>, and were in jeopardy.</p>

<p id="lu-ch8-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>25</strong></a> And he said unto them, Where is your faith?

<p id="lu-ch8-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>26</strong></a> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</p>

<p id="lu-ch8-v28" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>28</strong></a> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, <i>thou</i> Son of God most high?

<p id="lu-ch8-v29" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>29</strong></a> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.

<p id="lu-ch8-v30" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>30</strong></a> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p>

<p id="lu-ch8-v37" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>37</strong></a> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</p>
<p id="lu-ch8-v38" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>38</strong></a> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>

<p id="lu-ch8-v42" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>42</strong></a> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>
<p id="lu-ch8-v43" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="luke.html#lu-ch8"><strong><span class="hide-this">Lu8.</span>43</strong></a> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</p>
