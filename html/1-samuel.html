<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>1</strong></a> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>2</strong></a> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>3</strong></a> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>4</strong></a> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>5</strong></a> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>6</strong></a> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>7</strong></a> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>8</strong></a> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>9</strong></a> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>10</strong></a> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>11</strong></a> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>12</strong></a> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>13</strong></a> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>14</strong></a> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>15</strong></a> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>16</strong></a> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>17</strong></a> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>18</strong></a> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>19</strong></a> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>20</strong></a> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>21</strong></a> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>22</strong></a> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>23</strong></a> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>24</strong></a> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>25</strong></a> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>26</strong></a> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>27</strong></a> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>28</strong></a> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>1</strong></a> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>2</strong></a> There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>3</strong></a> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>4</strong></a> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>5</strong></a> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>6</strong></a> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>7</strong></a> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>8</strong></a> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>9</strong></a> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>10</strong></a> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>11</strong></a> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>12</strong></a> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>13</strong></a> And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>14</strong></a> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>15</strong></a> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>16</strong></a> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>17</strong></a> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>18</strong></a> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>19</strong></a> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>20</strong></a> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>21</strong></a> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>22</strong></a> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>23</strong></a> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>24</strong></a> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>25</strong></a> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>26</strong></a> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>27</strong></a> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>28</strong></a> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>29</strong></a> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>30</strong></a> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>31</strong></a> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>32</strong></a> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>33</strong></a> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>34</strong></a> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>35</strong></a> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa2.</span>36</strong></a> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>1</strong></a> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>2</strong></a> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>3</strong></a> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>4</strong></a> That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>5</strong></a> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>6</strong></a> And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>7</strong></a> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>8</strong></a> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>9</strong></a> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>10</strong></a> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>11</strong></a> And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>12</strong></a> In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>13</strong></a> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>14</strong></a> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>15</strong></a> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>16</strong></a> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>17</strong></a> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>18</strong></a> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>19</strong></a> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>20</strong></a> And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa3.</span>21</strong></a> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>1</strong></a> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>2</strong></a> And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>3</strong></a> And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>4</strong></a> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>5</strong></a> And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>6</strong></a> And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>7</strong></a> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>8</strong></a> Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>9</strong></a> Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>10</strong></a> And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>11</strong></a> And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>12</strong></a> And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>13</strong></a> And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>14</strong></a> And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>15</strong></a> Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>16</strong></a> And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa4.</span>17</strong></a> And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa7.</span>4</strong></a> Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>3</strong></a> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>4</strong></a> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>5</strong></a> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>6</strong></a> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>7</strong></a> And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>11</strong></a> And Samuel said, What hast thou done?

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>12</strong></a> Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>13</strong></a> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>14</strong></a> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>15</strong></a> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>16</strong></a> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>19</strong></a> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa13.</span>20</strong></a> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>3</strong></a> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>4</strong></a> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>5</strong></a> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>6</strong></a> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>7</strong></a> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>8</strong></a> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>9</strong></a> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>10</strong></a> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>11</strong></a> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>12</strong></a> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>13</strong></a> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>14</strong></a> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>15</strong></a> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>16</strong></a> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>17</strong></a> Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>18</strong></a> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>19</strong></a> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>20</strong></a> And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>21</strong></a> Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>22</strong></a> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>23</strong></a> So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>24</strong></a> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>25</strong></a> And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>26</strong></a> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>27</strong></a> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>28</strong></a> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>29</strong></a> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>30</strong></a> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>31</strong></a> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>32</strong></a> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>33</strong></a> Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>34</strong></a> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>35</strong></a> And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>36</strong></a> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>37</strong></a> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>38</strong></a> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>39</strong></a> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>40</strong></a> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>41</strong></a> Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>42</strong></a> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>43</strong></a> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>44</strong></a> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>45</strong></a> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>46</strong></a> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>47</strong></a> So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>48</strong></a> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>49</strong></a> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>50</strong></a> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>51</strong></a> And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa14.</span>52</strong></a> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>1</strong></a> Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>2</strong></a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>3</strong></a> Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>4</strong></a> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>5</strong></a> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>6</strong></a> And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>7</strong></a> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>8</strong></a> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>9</strong></a> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>10</strong></a> Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>11</strong></a> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>12</strong></a> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>13</strong></a> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>14</strong></a> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>15</strong></a> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>16</strong></a> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>17</strong></a> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>18</strong></a> And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>19</strong></a> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>20</strong></a> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>21</strong></a> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>22</strong></a> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>23</strong></a> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>24</strong></a> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>25</strong></a> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>26</strong></a> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>27</strong></a> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>28</strong></a> And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>29</strong></a> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>30</strong></a> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>31</strong></a> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>32</strong></a> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>33</strong></a> And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>34</strong></a> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa15.</span>35</strong></a> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>1</strong></a> And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>2</strong></a> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>3</strong></a> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>4</strong></a> And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>5</strong></a> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>6</strong></a> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>7</strong></a> But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>8</strong></a> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>9</strong></a> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>10</strong></a> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>11</strong></a> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>12</strong></a> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>13</strong></a> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>14</strong></a> But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>15</strong></a> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>16</strong></a> Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa16.</span>17</strong></a> And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>10</strong></a> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>24</strong></a> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>25</strong></a> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>26</strong></a> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>27</strong></a> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>28</strong></a> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>29</strong></a> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>30</strong></a> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>31</strong></a> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>32</strong></a> And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>33</strong></a> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>34</strong></a> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>35</strong></a> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>36</strong></a> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>37</strong></a> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>38</strong></a> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>39</strong></a> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>40</strong></a> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>41</strong></a> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>42</strong></a> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>43</strong></a> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>44</strong></a> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>45</strong></a> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>46</strong></a> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>47</strong></a> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>48</strong></a> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>49</strong></a> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>50</strong></a> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>51</strong></a> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>52</strong></a> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>53</strong></a> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>54</strong></a> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>55</strong></a> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>56</strong></a> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>57</strong></a> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa17.</span>58</strong></a> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>3</strong></a> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>6</strong></a> And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>7</strong></a> And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>8</strong></a> And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>9</strong></a> And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>10</strong></a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>11</strong></a> And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>12</strong></a> And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>18</strong></a> And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>19</strong></a> But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa18.</span>26</strong></a> And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa19.</span>11</strong></a> Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa19.</span>12</strong></a> So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa19.</span>16</strong></a> And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa19.</span>17</strong></a> And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa19.</span>18</strong></a> So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>1</strong></a> And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>2</strong></a> And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>3</strong></a> And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>4</strong></a> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>5</strong></a> And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>6</strong></a> If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>8</strong></a> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>9</strong></a> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>10</strong></a> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>11</strong></a> And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>12</strong></a> And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>13</strong></a> The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>14</strong></a> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>15</strong></a> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>16</strong></a> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>17</strong></a> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>18</strong></a> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>19</strong></a> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>20</strong></a> And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>21</strong></a> And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>22</strong></a> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>23</strong></a> And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>24</strong></a> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>25</strong></a> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>26</strong></a> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>27</strong></a> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>28</strong></a> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>29</strong></a> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>30</strong></a> Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>31</strong></a> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>32</strong></a> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>33</strong></a> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>34</strong></a> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>35</strong></a> And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>36</strong></a> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>37</strong></a> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>38</strong></a> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>39</strong></a> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>40</strong></a> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>41</strong></a> And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa20.</span>42</strong></a> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>1</strong></a> Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>2</strong></a> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>3</strong></a> Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>4</strong></a> And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>5</strong></a> And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>6</strong></a> So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>7</strong></a> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>8</strong></a> And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>9</strong></a> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>10</strong></a> And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>11</strong></a> And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>12</strong></a> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>13</strong></a> And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa21.</span>14</strong></a> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>4</strong></a> And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>7</strong></a> Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>9</strong></a> Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>10</strong></a> And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>11</strong></a> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>14</strong></a> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa22.</span>15</strong></a> Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa23.</span>5</strong></a> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa23.</span>6</strong></a> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa23.</span>10</strong></a> Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</p>

Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>5</strong></a> And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>7</strong></a> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>8</strong></a> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king.

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>11</strong></a> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>12</strong></a> The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>16</strong></a> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa24.</span>17</strong></a> And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>1</strong></a> And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>2</strong></a> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>3</strong></a> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>4</strong></a> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>5</strong></a> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>6</strong></a> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>7</strong></a> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>8</strong></a> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>9</strong></a> And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>10</strong></a> And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>11</strong></a> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>12</strong></a> So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>13</strong></a> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>14</strong></a> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>15</strong></a> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>16</strong></a> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>17</strong></a> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>18</strong></a> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>19</strong></a> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>20</strong></a> And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>21</strong></a> Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>22</strong></a> So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>23</strong></a> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>24</strong></a> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>25</strong></a> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>26</strong></a> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>27</strong></a> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>28</strong></a> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>29</strong></a> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>30</strong></a> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>31</strong></a> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>32</strong></a> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>33</strong></a> And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>34</strong></a> For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>35</strong></a> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>36</strong></a> And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>37</strong></a> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>38</strong></a> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>39</strong></a> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>40</strong></a> And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>41</strong></a> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa25.</span>42</strong></a> And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>10</strong></a> David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>11</strong></a> The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>12</strong></a> So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>13</strong></a> Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>14</strong></a> And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>15</strong></a> And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>16</strong></a> This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>17</strong></a> And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>18</strong></a> And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>19</strong></a> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>20</strong></a> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>21</strong></a> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>22</strong></a> And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa26.</span>23</strong></a> The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>1</strong></a> Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>2</strong></a> And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>3</strong></a> And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>4</strong></a> Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>5</strong></a> And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>6</strong></a> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>7</strong></a> And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>8</strong></a> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>9</strong></a> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>10</strong></a> And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>11</strong></a> And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>12</strong></a> All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa31.</span>13</strong></a> And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
