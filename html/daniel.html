<p id="da-ch1-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>1</strong></a> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>2</strong></a> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>3</strong></a> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <i>certain</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>4</strong></a> Children in whom <i>was</i> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <i>had</i> ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>5</strong></a> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>6</strong></a> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v7" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>7</strong></a> Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <i>the name</i> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v8" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>8</strong></a> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>9</strong></a> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>10</strong></a> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <i>are</i> of your sort? then shall ye make <i>me</i> endanger my head to the king.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>11</strong></a> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>12</strong></a> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>13</strong></a> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>14</strong></a> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>15</strong></a> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>16</strong></a> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>17</strong></a> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>18</strong></a> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>19</strong></a> And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>20</strong></a> And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers that <i>were</i> in all his realm.</p>
<p id="da-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da1.</span>21</strong></a> And Daniel continued <i>even</i> unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>

<p id="da-ch2-v1" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>1</strong></a> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>2</strong></a> Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams.

<p id="da-ch2-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>3</strong></a> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>4</strong></a> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>5</strong></a> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v6" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>6</strong></a> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>

<p id="da-ch2-v10" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>10</strong></a> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore <i>there is</i> no king, lord, nor ruler, <i>that</i> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v11" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>11</strong></a> And <i>it is</i> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>12</strong></a> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v13" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>13</strong></a> And the decree went forth that the wise <i>men</i> should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>14</strong></a> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon:</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>15</strong></a> He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why <i>is</i> the decree <i>so</i> hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>16</strong></a> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>17</strong></a> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v18" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>18</strong></a> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>19</strong></a> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>20</strong></a> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>21</strong></a> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p>

<p id="da-ch2-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>24</strong></a> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>25</strong></a> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>26</strong></a> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
<p id="da-ch2-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch2"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da2.</span>27</strong></a> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise <i>men</i>, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p>

<p id="da-ch6-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="daniel.html#da-ch6"><strong><span class="hide-this">Da6.</span>25</strong></a> Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
