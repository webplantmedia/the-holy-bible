<p id="mr-ch16-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="mark.html#mr-ch16"><strong><span class="hide-this">Mr16.</span>2</strong></a> And very early in the morning the first <i>day</i> of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p id="mr-ch16-v3" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="mark.html#mr-ch16"><strong><span class="hide-this">Mr16.</span>3</strong></a> And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>
