<p id="heb-ch7-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="hebrews.html#heb-ch7"><strong><span class="hide-this">Heb7.</span>12</strong></a> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>

<p id="heb-ch9-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="hebrews.html#heb-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Heb9.</span>20</strong></a> Saying, This <i>is</i> the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</p>

<p id="heb-ch9-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="hebrews.html#heb-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Heb9.</span>23</strong></a> <i>It was</i> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
<p id="heb-ch9-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="hebrews.html#heb-ch9"><strong><span class="hide-this">Heb9.</span>24</strong></a> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, <i>which are</i> the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</p>
