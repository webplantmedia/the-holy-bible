<p id="1sa-ch1-v2" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>2</strong></a> And he had two wives; the name of the one <i>was</i> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>

<p id="1sa-ch1-v4" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>4</strong></a> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v5" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>5</strong></a> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>

<p id="1sa-ch1-v9" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>9</strong></a> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p>

<p id="1sa-ch1-v12" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>12</strong></a> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</p>

<p id="1sa-ch1-v14" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>14</strong></a> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v15" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>15</strong></a> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I <i>am</i> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v16" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>16</strong></a> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v17" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>17</strong></a> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant <i>thee</i> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</p>

<p id="1sa-ch1-v19" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>19</strong></a> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v20" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>20</strong></a> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, <i>saying</i>, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v21" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>21</strong></a> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v22" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>22</strong></a> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <i>I will not go up</i> until the child be weaned, and <i>then</i> I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v23" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>23</strong></a> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word.

<p id="1sa-ch1-v24" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>24</strong></a> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child <i>was</i> young.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v25" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>25</strong></a> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v26" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>26</strong></a> And she said, Oh my lord, <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</p>
<p id="1sa-ch1-v27" class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor" href="1-samuel.html#1sa-ch1"><strong><span class="hide-this">1Sa1.</span>27</strong></a> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</p>
